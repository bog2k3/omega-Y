SODL (Simplified Object Description Language) specifications

data types:
	1. absolute number: 13
	2. relative number: 23%
	3. string: "hello"
		4. predefined enumeration: someEnumValue
	5. IDentifier: #someID
object property declaration:
propertyName: value1 value2 ...
some properties are mandatory, others are optional; ordering is important
child object declaration:
child1 #childId "childPrimaryPropValues" 42 {
}
primary properties (all of the mandatory properties are primary) can be defined directly after the child element type as such:
child1 "stringPropValue" 13 {
}
both primary and secondary properties can be defined within the object's block with the property declaration syntax (name: value)

a class can be defined with specific properties that will be inherited by all instances:
class someType primaryProp {
    secondary props and children
    ...
}
...
@someType {	// instantiation
    ...
}
data bindings and action callbacks are referenced with the $ symbol:
button "OK" $okAction		// bind $okAction callback to button
textField numeric $dataName	// bind $dataName value to field
